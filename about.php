              Pollution enters the Earth's atmosphere in many different ways. Most air pollution is created by people, taking the form of emissions from factories, cars, planes, or aerosol cans. Second-hand cigarette smoke is also considered air pollution.
			  These man-made sources of pollution are called anthropogenic sources.

              Air pollution is usually thought of as smoke from large factories or exhaust from vehicles.
               But there are many types of indoor air pollution as well.
