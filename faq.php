            <p>Summer smog episodes in Ontario are often a part of a regional weather condition that prevails over much of northeastern North America.  Elevated levels of ozone and fine particulate matter are typically due to weather patterns that affect the lower Great Lakes region.  Such weather patterns are invariably associated with slow-moving high pressure cells across the region and result in the long-range transport of smog pollutants from neighbouring U.S. industrial and urbanized states during the flow of warm air from the southwest to the northeast.<p>          </div>
